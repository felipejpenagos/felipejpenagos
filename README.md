## Hi, I'm Felipe

I’m an engineering student at Duke, all the way from Colombia to North Carolina.

### 🔬 What I'm Working On
- **💡[StateDynamics Lab](LINK_HERE)** — a research project exploring dynamic systems and Bellman-based reinforcement learning, to integrate optimal financial decision-making within a stochastic control system.
- **📐Research/Teacher Assistant for Dr. Henri P. Gavin** — helping translate his MATLAB optimization and uncertainty-modeling library into a modern Python package for CEE251L. Includes custom-parametrized probability distribution modules, stochastic simulation routines, and classical optimization algorithms **[Multivarious](LINK_HERE)**.
- **🌐 Open to collaborating** on projects that apply theory into real-world systems!
