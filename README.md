## Hi there 👋, 

My name is Felipe, and I'm an engineering student at Duke– all the way from Colombia to North Carolina!

### 🔬 What I'm Currently Working On
- **🧮 Research Assistant** — helping translate Dr. Henri P. Gavin's MATLAB optimization and uncertainty-modeling library into a modern Python package for CEE251L,  **[Multivarious](https://github.com/hpgavin/multivarious)**.
- **💡 I'm pursuing a project called [StateDynamics](https://github.com/felipejpenagos/StateDynamics-Lab)**, aiming to leverage probability theory and reinforcement learning to integrate financial decision-making within a stochastic control system.
- **🌐 Open to collaborating** on projects that apply theory into real-world challenges,
  - reach me at felipejpenagos@gmail.com
