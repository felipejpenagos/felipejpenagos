## Hi, I'm Felipe

I’m an engineering student at Duke majoring in Financial Engineering.

### 🔬 What I'm Working On
- **💡[StateDynamics Lab](LINK_HERE)** — a research project exploring dynamic systems, reinforcement learning, and Bellman-based decision processes. Current focus: modeling corporate financial health as a state-space system and studying optimal interventions using stochastic control, chess analogies, and simulations under uncertainty.
- **📐Research/Teacher Assistant for Dr. Henri P. Gavin** — translating his MATLAB optimization and uncertainty-modeling library into a modern Python package for CEE251L. Includes custom-parametrized probability distribution modules, stochastic simulation routines, and classical optimization algorithms of his original code **(LINK_HERE)**.
- **🌐 Open to collaborating** on research and experimental projects that blend theory with real-world systems!
